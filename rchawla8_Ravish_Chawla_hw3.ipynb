For instance, Cluster #2 shows values relating to a populace or geography, such as `slums`, `populace`, and `dwellers`. Cluster #5 shows movie words, such as `dvd`, `rating`, `film`, `imdb`, and `netflix`,and Cluster #6 shows some emotional and psychological words, such as `alienation`, `awareness`, `anxiety`, and `hostility`. This shows that the Word2Vec model trained well and the Clustering algorithm was properly able to distinsuish the words."

    "The results show that Topic Modeling with LDA using 10 Topics works best for Sentiment classification. Although the results for 20 topics is close, it is slightly lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results are similar for this model to those with a simple bag of words model, as computed in Homework 1. Using TfIdf in that homework results in an accuracy of around 0.89, which was better than the accuracy acheived in this assignment. However, the difference in AUC is only around 5-6%, which shows that this model is able to acheive similarly good results. With more parameter tuning, it should be possible to get higher accuracy/AUC with this model as well. Furthermore, the intermediate results of Word clusters show that Topic Modeling and Word2Vec works really well in gathering similar categories of Words in word analysis, such as words that have similar meaning or context. This was not possible with TfIdf, which shows that Bag of Words is not nearly as good in Semantic classification with some features. There are 3 things I would do to improve this classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I would try more and better Parameter tuning techniques. Although my AUC was high enough with the last 2 models, I think it could be further improved. The approach I would use for parameter tuning is Grid Search CV with SKlearn, and I would try to tune more than just 2 parameters, including the Number of Estimators.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. I would try a different model than Random Forests. In Homework 1, we used SVM, and saw good overall AUC with it, and lower with Random Forest. Although Random Forests are an ensemble technique, they do not guarantee high accuracy with this dataset, and other models should be explored before settling on one. The models I would test are going to be SVM and Logistic Regression. If the results with those models are good, I would combine them with the Random Forest model as a stronger ensemble set to obtain even higher accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Another thing I would try is different featurization techniques with LDA. We see a drastic improvement in results with LDA, up to 85% accuracy, and the word lists show that there is a strong coherance between words of a collection between topics. I think the approaches I would try are going to be to try different parameters with LDA, such as the number of topics, and whether there should be a different pre-processor for the corpus. I used TfIdf pre-processor with LDA, and saw a decrease in accuracy, but perhaps a different one would be more useful. For instance, using the results from the Google's word2vec model and piping them through the LDA. These techniques could provide an improvement in overall accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The last thing I would try is get more data. As of right now, we have 25,000 reviews, where each has multiple words. Although the dataset is large, having more data will improve the model, specifically is the dataset is labeled."
